Security Orchestrator - Comprehensive Security Assessment Tool
Overview
Security Orchestrator is a unified platform that automates multiple security scanning and reconnaissance tools into a single workflow, making penetration testing more efficient and organized. This "Swiss Army knife" for security professionals brings together dozens of open-source security tools with a user-friendly GUI interface and professional reporting capabilities.

Key Features
üîß Automation & Integration
Single-command workflow that runs multiple tools sequentially

Cross-platform support (Linux/Kali, Windows)

Automatic output parsing and correlation

Tool availability checking before execution

üß† Intelligent Analysis
Attack path generation - identifies potential exploitation routes

Vulnerability correlation across different tools

Risk assessment and prioritization

Metasploit integration for exploit suggestions

üìä Comprehensive Reporting
Multiple report formats: Text, PDF with raw outputs

Structured results organized by tool

Executive summaries and detailed findings

Raw tool outputs preserved for manual review

üñ•Ô∏è User-Friendly Interface
Tabbed GUI with four main sections

Intuitive target configuration

Real-time scan progress monitoring

Organized result presentation

Tool Components
Main Security Scanner
Nmap: Network discovery and port scanning

Searchsploit: Exploit database searching

Enum4linux: SMB service enumeration

Wapiti: Web application vulnerability scanning

Nuclei: Template-based vulnerability scanning

Metasploit: Exploit suggestion generation

Automated Internal Enumeration
Comprehensive network reconnaissance

Multiple scanning phases:

Nmap discovery (DNS, ports, vulnerabilities)

Web enumeration (Nikto, WhatWeb, Gobuster)

SMB enumeration

Visual reconnaissance (EyeWitness)

Organized folder structure for results

External OSINT
Domain and internet-facing reconnaissance

WHOIS lookups

DNS enumeration (DNSRecon)

Subdomain discovery (Sublist3r)

Email harvesting (theHarvester)

Installation & Requirements
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Required security tools (Nmap, Searchsploit, Enum4linux, Wapiti, Nuclei, Metasploit, etc.)

Kali Linux recommended (or equivalent security distribution)

Installation
bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd security-orchestrator

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python security_orchestrator.py
Usage
Main Scanner
Navigate to the "Main Scanner" tab

Enter target IP/Range

Select output directory

All 65535 Ports (Thorough - 30-60+ min)

Click "Start Scan" to initiate comprehensive security assessment

Automated Internal Enumeration
Select the "Automated Enumeration" tab

Configure target and output directory

Choose from available modules:

Nmap Discovery

Web Enumeration

SMB Enumeration

Visual Reconnaissance

Start the enumeration process

External OSINT
Go to the "External OSINT" tab

Enter target domain

Set output directory

Select OSINT modules:

WHOIS Lookup

DNSRecon

Sublist3r

theHarvester

Begin external reconnaissance

Use Cases
Penetration Testing - Comprehensive security assessments

Vulnerability Management - Identifying and prioritizing security issues

Security Research - Automated reconnaissance and analysis

Red Team Operations - Attack path identification and exploitation

Educational Purposes - Learning security tools and methodologies

‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Considerations
IMPORTANT: This tool should only be used for:

Authorized security testing

Educational purposes in controlled environments

Research with proper permissions

The user is responsible for:

Obtaining proper authorization before scanning

Complying with all applicable laws and regulations

Following responsible disclosure practices

Respecting privacy and data protection requirements

Technical Architecture
Tool Wrappers: Python wrappers for each security tool handle execution, output parsing, and error handling

Orchestration Engine: Manages tool execution sequence and data flow

Cross-Platform Support: Automatic OS detection and command adjustment

Report Generator: Creates comprehensive text and PDF reports
