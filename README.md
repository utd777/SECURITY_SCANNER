Nmap: Network discovery and security auditing

Searchsploit: Exploit database searching

Nikto: Web server vulnerability scanner

enum4linux: SMB enumeration tool

w3af: Web application attack and audit framework

Metasploit: Exploit suggestion generation

📋 Prerequisites
Required Tools
The following tools should be installed and available in your system PATH:

Nmap (nmap)

Searchsploit (searchsploit) - Part of ExploitDB

Nikto (nikto)

enum4linux (enum4linux or enum4linux-ng)

w3af (w3af_console or w3af)

Metasploit Framework (msfconsole) - For exploit suggestions

Kali Linux Installation
All required tools come pre-installed on Kali Linux. Simply run:

bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap exploitdb nikto enum4linux-ng w3af metasploit-framework
Other Linux Distributions
bash
# Install required packages
sudo apt install python3-tk python3-pip nmap nikto
sudo pip install tkinter

# Install ExploitDB for searchsploit
git clone https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb.git /opt/exploitdb
ln -sf /opt/exploitdb/searchsploit /usr/local/bin/searchsploit

# Install other tools as needed
🎯 Quick Start
1. Download and Run
bash
# Download the script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/security_orchestrator.py

# Make executable
chmod +x security_orchestrator.py

# Run the application
python3 security_orchestrator.py
2. Basic Usage
Enter Nmap Command:

Default: nmap -sV -p 1-1000 192.168.1.100

Customize ports and options as needed

Set Target (optional):

Use presets for common targets like Metasploitable3

Or enter custom IP/range

Select Output Directory:

Default: results/

Choose where to save scan results

Run Comprehensive Scan:

Click "Run Comprehensive Scan"

Monitor progress in real-time

View results in the output console

🔧 Configuration
The tool automatically detects tool locations and provides fallback options. Key configuration points:

Tool Paths: Auto-detected, with manual fallbacks

Timeouts: Configurable per tool

HTTP Services: Customizable port and service detection

Output Format: Adjustable report formatting

Customizing Tool Paths
Edit the Config class in the script to modify tool locations:

python
'tools': {
    'nmap': {
        'executable': '/custom/path/to/nmap',
        'timeout': 300,
        'default_args': ['-v']
    },
    # ... other tools
}
🎨 GUI Features
Real-time Progress: Live updates during scanning

Tool Status: Visual indicators for tool availability

Output Console: Comprehensive logging and results display

Preset Configurations: Quick setup for common scenarios

Export Functionality: Save reports to custom locations

🔍 Advanced Usage
Custom Nmap Commands
The tool parses and enhances Nmap commands to ensure XML output. You can use any valid Nmap options:

bash
# Comprehensive scan with scripts
nmap -sS -sV -sC -O -p- --script vuln,default,safe 192.168.1.0/24

# UDP scan combination
nmap -sU -sS -p U:53,111,137,T:21-25,80,443,135,139,445 192.168.1.100
Targeted Scanning
Web Services: Automatically detects HTTP/HTTPS ports for Nikto and w3af

SMB Services: Triggers enum4linux for port 445

Database Services: MySQL, PostgreSQL detection and analysis

🛡️ Security Considerations
Use only on authorized systems and networks

Ensure proper legal permissions before scanning

The tool is designed for security assessment and penetration testing

Respect privacy and applicable laws

❓ Troubleshooting
Common Issues
"Tool not found" errors:

Ensure tools are installed and in PATH

Check tool availability in the GUI status panel

Permission errors:

Run with appropriate privileges for network scanning

Ensure write permissions for output directory

Timeout issues:

Adjust timeout values in configuration for slower networks

Use more specific Nmap scans to reduce scope

XML parsing errors:

Ensure Nmap completes successfully

Check for malformed XML output from tools

Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by modifying the logger initialization:

python
logger = SecurityOrchestratorLogger(console_level=logging.DEBUG)
